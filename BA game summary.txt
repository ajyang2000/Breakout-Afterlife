Breakout: Afterlife

Starts out as a simple 2d* breakout game.
The player has a shield at the bottom of the screen with a certain amount of hp.
A certain amount of hp is lost every time a ball sneaks past the paddle.**
When the hp runs out, the shield is dropped, and the next ball to pass through causes a game over.

Each level consists of a certain formation of bricks.*5*
Once the bricks are all broken, the player continues to the next level.
As levels progress, they will start to contain bricks with more hit points,
	and maybe the player even has to hit a button before being able to start breaking the bricks.

Every certain amount of levels beat (letâ€™s say every 5-10), the player enters a boss battle.***
Each boss is a paddle on the top of the screen, and similar to the player, has a shield behind them.
The player must break through enough bricks to get their ball to the boss's side,
	and cause damage to their shield.
They win the battle when the shield is destroyed and a final blow is dealt.

Each time the player beats a boss, they earn a certain amount of PERMANENT upgrade tokens.*4*
This means that even after they have a game over,
	they can head back to a shop to buy upgrades to their paddle and ball(s),
	purchase special abilities, and increase the percentage chance of special bricks spawning in
	when each level is loaded


Ideas
-a permanent upgrade (PERMA) allowing the player to control the ball speed
	(speed it up or slow it down within a certain speed range),
	further upgrades can give it a great range of speed control

-a temporary boost (TEMP) "sticky" which allows the ball to stick to the paddle the next time they collide,
	and the ball is released when the player presses the action button


Notes

* let's start out with a 2d space first since I think my art style is geared a little
	more towards that

** a life is still lost even if there are multiple balls active on the screen

*** keep in mind the levels and bosses will be built modularly, so making "new"
	bosses will be as simple as modifying values to make each experience
	FEEL unique

*4* (error 404 - page not found)

*5* (concept idea:) each brick will load into its designated position on the screen after consulting a
	random chance brick generator
	[i.e. 95% chance normal brick,
		4% chance bonus brick (which drops +hp+ or PERMA permanent upgrade coin),
		1% chance special brick(drops temporary boost, like "sticky", "new ball", "full shield recharge")]
	
	the percentages will fluctuate depending on what boosts the player has active
