*0* I have done my best to list my tasks in order of priority.
	
	Hey, Alison! Did you know you can use <COMMAND + F> buttons on Mac to use the "find" feature in a text file
		or webpage? If you highlight a note reference (i.e. *0*) anywhere in this file, you can use that feature
		to easily jump down to the the note itself, and again once more to jump right back to the reference
		where you came from!

	I try to write text files with this format so any ideas or explanation I want to add to
		a topic can be placed somewhere where they won't clutter the core topics above.
		Imagine if I wrote all this info right at the top of the document, and we had to scroll past it
		every time we opened it - no thank you! lol



*1* I found out a bit late into the project that I don't have the legal right to use the drum pack in that song
	for our purposes, and don't currently see the need in paying the $80 to get it lol

	I'm just gonna start over. I think I can do a copy-paste on all the other instruments at least! Oopsies.



*2* This will just be a modified version of Afterlife Gameplay - definitely more intense than
	the regular OST!

*3* I'll add them here once their respective plans have been posted
