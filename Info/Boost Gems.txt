-- BOOST GEMS --
----------------

Hey there, just a quick note! I just went scrolling through pseudocode and realized that I don't think I ever clearly described
	 the concept in my mind about the boost gems

Ideally, they would sit at the given (x,y) offset,
		which I have provided for each gem socket. *1*
	that makes them appear to be embedded into the visual "slots" of the paddle
	the transform size/percentage for the gem is parallel with any potential size transformation of the player's currently equipped paddle
The slots are indicated by the little grey circles on each paddle.

I don't see why not to allow the player to collect up to 3 of each of these gems,
	as I believe the values that they modify/strengthen are built to handle each of those boosts' cases dynamically


I guess the reason I didn't get around to mentioning that was because I never conceptualized the INVENTORY space.
And to that point, if i came up with a simple, functional pseudo-code concept for the INVENTORY space, 
	is it realistic to think that we could have that put together by the deadline?
	Because I can definitely put that concept together on the fly!


-- NOTES --

*1* Gem placement offsets, assuming the position of the top left pixel of the player's current paddle sprite is 0, 0:
	red, green, and blue paddles have 1 gem socket at - (13, 1)
	light and dark paddles have 2 - (3, 1) and (31, 1)
	neon has 3 - (5, 4), (21, 5), and (37, 4)
