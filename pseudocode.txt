PSEUDOCODE for Breakout: Afterlife


[*, ***, *5*] - examples of references to notes that I leave at the bottom of this file. That way you can CTRL+F your down there and back up to read some extra thoughts on the topics marked

"POLISH stage" is a term that clarifies that those things are not crucial to the finished game. They just might make it feel really nice if we find the time to do it



--program starts--

The User enters the Title Screen:
	the User can press START to enter the main menu at any time,
		POLISH stage- this prompt will be casually displayed at the bottom of the screen while this happens:
			a very simple ai paddle simulates gameplay by sending off a ball in a random direction and following it to deflect it from hitting the 
			bottom of the screen (LATER development, or POLISH stage for sure lol)

		POLISH stage- it would be cool to have bricks load in on the top half of the screen in the formation of a string that displays the title of the game
			as the player waits on this screen, the ai paddle will slowly but surely chip away at the brick formation that constitues the title

The User enters the Main Menu Screen:

	The main_menu( ) opens up with these MENU.MANE.BUTTONS** :

		 [-New Game-]***
		  [-Options-]
		  [-Credits-]
		   [-Quit-]
	
	-New Game is highlighted when the player enters the scene- (Cam, VFX)
	The player can press the up/down arrow keys or D-pad buttons to navigate these options
		-Which will be swiftly responded to by a soft tick SFX (consider yourself warned)- (for Cam to do, SFX)
		-This will also change the hightlighted menu option in the direction the player chooses- (Cam, VFX)
			
	The player can also press the ACTION button (spacebar on keyboard or X)** to enter whichever menu button is currently highlighted
		-a "boiyoiyoing" sound plays to indicate that the player has made their choice- (Cam, SFX)
		-the highlighted menu option will react in some way to indicate the finality of their choice- (Cam, VFX)
		The player will enter the respective scene or menu

	If player chooses New Game
		A new save file is created in the player's honor. *4*
		Enter Main Game Loop--->


__GAME LOOP__
------------------

The player enters the Game Menu screen, greeted by these options/buttons:

	[-Start-]
	[-Inventory-]
	[-Shop-]
	[-Options-]
	[-Quit-]

The player uses the same controls as above to navigate the menu and select a menu button
-meanwhile the regular Menu VFX and SFX happen- (Cam, VFX + SFX)


The player plays the game _LeveltoLevel_ until they die or beat the game
	The bricks all load into place. The brick formation is unique to each level
	-The background VFX begin- (for Cam to do, VFX)
	A single ball is connected to the player's paddle, and is released when the player presses the "action" button,
		(keyboard key "spacebar")
		(Dualshock controller button "X")
		-boop SFX happens- (Cam, SFX)

		The ball starts moving in a random, generally upward-facing direction
		It continues on its trajectory until it collides with a wall or brick
		If the ball hits a brick:
			-boom/crack SFX happens- (Cam, SFX)
			-VFX to indicate the impact (light up)- (Cam, SFX)
			The brick loses a certain amount of hp equal to the strength or power the ball currently has. *5*
			Does the brick have 0 or less hp right now?
				-That brick dead af, break/explode VFX- (Cam, VFX)
				-break/explode SFX- (Cam, SFX)
				Did that brick have any special items in it?
					drop the item/boost/buff slowly down towards the bottome of the screen for the player to collect it (or avoid it)
				

		Elseif the ball hits a wall:
			oh god here comes more trigonometry, *6*
				which makes things happen
			-smol boop SFX happens- (Cam, SFX)
			-maybe some tiny little particles to show the impact- (Cam, VFX)

		Elseif the ball hits the player's paddle:
			(Cam, SFX + VFX)
			send the ball off in a generally upward-facing direction
				if the player hit the ball close to the right edge of the paddle:
					the direction should redirect rightward
				elseif the player hit the ball close to the left edge of the paddle:
					the direction should redirect leftward
				else
					do the normal trig. to bounce the ball away just the same as on the wall impact

		Elseif the ball hits the player's shield:
			ouchie. player's shield loses hp
			deflect the ball as if it hit a wall
			if player's shield hp <= 0:
				shield drops, and panic ensues O_O
				-so much SFX + VFX to warn the player not to let that shit happen ever again or else bad things- (Cam, VFX + SFX)

		Elseif the ball hits the newly exposed bottom of the screen:
			GAME OVER happens
			-all those other SFX and VFX didn't keep you from letting this happen again? Well now you get some more to indicate that
				we told you this would happen- (Cam, VFX + SFX)
			The player then returns to the beginning of the main _Game Loop_ to think about what they just did
			They can then spend their money on permanent upgrades in the shop to ensure this doesn't happen again
			
				
				
	For each Level beat:
		The player earns a small amount of PERMA tokens, which they can use later in the SHOP
		The background changes slightly in some way to indicate that the player is in a new level
		Any temporary effects or bonuses applied to the paddle, ball or balls, and bricks during the this level are deactivated
		If this upcoming level is an arbitrary multiple of 5 or 10:
			Enter the boss stage-->
		Else:
			Start at the beginning of the _LeveltoLevel_ loop, this time following the next level's unique brick formation

	

They reach a boss stage
	The bricks are loaded in as usual, following this boss battle's unique brick formation
	The boss's paddle/ball is generated at the top of the screen
	The level begins as usual
	-an absolute hurricane worth of SFX and VFX to accompany this epic battle- (Cam, SFX + VFX)
	If the player beats the boss they enter a rewards screen where any bonuses or unlocks are displayed:


					       [-woohoo! TOKENS! (here's how many you earned: 1000)-]

								      [-ITEM get!-] 

				[-(displays picture of FANCY. NEW. PADDLE. that you just unlocked for making it this far)-]
					-also, so much SFX and VFX happen here. much congratulate-- (Cam, VFX + SFX)

		
			The player presses X or spacebar to continue, which will be displayed to them so they know
			They are then teleported to a new world where they essentially go back to the start _LeveltoLevel_ loop and play increasingly harder levels
			UNLESS this is the last boss, in which case:
				-thanks for playing! you won!-
				-credits-
				End Game and go back to the start of _Game Loop_
				(I feel like there inevitably has to be something more that happens here, as per the theme XD )
				

	Elseif the player loses
		Treat it like a normal level losing, the whole GAME-OVER shabang,
			Then go back to the Game Menu at the start of the main _Game Loop_






NOTES

* I'm not sure if "MAIN" is a restricted keyword in this context, so I'm just placeholding that word with "MANE" for now to indicate that..
		the player is currently located in the main menu.
	And to that point, the term "MENU" could come with its own complications. lmao...

    ^^ this is a big resource to find answers to those types of questions for sure ^^


** I'm a Playstation guy all the way, so I'll just use that controller's mapping for now

*** POLISH STAGE - Maybe the menu could be built to add in a [-Load Game-] if the player has an active save file

*4* POLISH STAGE - I'm not super familiar with the "industry standard" as far as saving player progress goes. Can we pop it into a .json file? a .txt?
	I genuinely have no idea lol. If we have time near the end, we can have the autosave occur after each boss is beat

*5* The ball's power starts at 1 on a new game, and becomes progressively more powerful when the player purchases PERM upgrades.
	The ball's power may also be temporarily multiplied or divided by a boost or buff, respectively

*6* I can always do my best to help out with the mathematical part if needed. otherwise bless your soul for inevitably doing a much better job on it than I ever will lol
