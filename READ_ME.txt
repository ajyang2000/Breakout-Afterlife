Some general communication about this upcoming week:

- any and all of what I've written in the pseudo and summary is subject to change,
	so change/modify/remove any aspects of those as you wish,
	and do what makes the most sense for your flow and abilities

- leave notes anywhere, indicated by a unique reference character such as "$" or "#"
	that'll help us find any new updates/patches/communication easily by using CTRL+F / CMD+F

- take all the time you need on the base mechanics, since all the other things we create next are going to be dependent on them

- message me whenever, and I'll get back to you when I can
	I'm more than happy to answer any questions I can, and when I can't, I'm always interested in finding answers somewhere

- i get distracted here and there, so you might find unfinished thoughts at some point. oops.

- lastly, remember to just keep having fun with this. it is a small detail, but also the most important one.
	why else would we be making games if not to be showing other people how much fun they can have?
	the only way we can do that is by having a little fun for ourselves first!
